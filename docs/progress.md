- Installed `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `bits-ui` for shadcn-svelte foundation
- Created dark theme CSS variables in `src/web/src/app.css` (custom palette with blue-purple primary accent)
- Created `cn()` utility in `src/web/src/lib/utils.ts`
- Created auth store (`src/web/src/lib/stores/auth.svelte.ts`) with reactive Svelte 5 runes: login, register, logout, refresh, init
- Created API helper (`src/web/src/lib/api.ts`) with automatic JWT injection and transparent token refresh on 401
- Created login page (`/login`) and register page (`/register`) with form validation and error display
- Root layout initializes auth state via refresh token on mount; shows loading state until ready

## Run Log

### Run 1 (2026-03-07)
- All files created per plan
- Postgres exposed on port 5440 (5432-5434 were occupied by existing instances)
- Replaced Makefile/gofer with CLAUDE.md documenting raw commands (Windows path issues with both Make and gofer task runners)
- SvelteKit 5 with Vite 7, adapter-static 3

### Run 2 (2026-03-07)
- All files created per plan
- Access token expiry set to 5 minutes (changed from planned 15 min for tighter security)
- `OPEN_REGISTRATION` env var defaults to true; set to `false` to close registration
- `JWT_SECRET` env var with dev fallback and warning log

### Run 3 — Channels, WebSocket & Messages (Backend Only)
- Added `gorilla/websocket` dependency
- Created `src/internal/httputil/` with shared HTTP helpers (WriteJSON, WriteError, DecodeJSON)
- Channel CRUD requires admin for create/update/delete; list/get requires auth
- WebSocket connects via `GET /api/ws?token=<JWT>` (query param auth since browsers can't set WS headers)
- Message cursor pagination uses `before_time` + `before_id` query params (both required together)
- Hub uses channel-based select loop for all operations — no mutexes needed
- sqlc named params used for GetMessagesByChannel to get proper Go types

### Run 4 (2026-03-08)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (no PostCSS config needed)
- Dark-only theme — no light mode toggle (per plan: single dark theme)
- Primary color set to `231 77% 60%` (blue-purple, similar to Discord's blurple)
- Auth store uses Svelte 5 runes (`$state`) via `.svelte.ts` file convention
- API helper does transparent 401 → refresh → retry flow
- No shadcn-svelte CLI used; bits-ui installed manually, `cn()` utility created by hand
- Vite proxy avoids CORS issues during development

### Chi Router + Layered Architecture Refactor (2026-03-08)
- Switched from `http.ServeMux` to `chi` router for cleaner route groups and middleware chaining
- Separated HTTP handlers from business logic into a layered architecture:
  - `src/internal/service/` — pure business logic (AuthService, ChannelService, MessageService)
  - `src/internal/handler/` — HTTP handlers (AuthHandler, ChannelHandler, MessageHandler)
  - `src/internal/middleware/auth.go` — RequireAuth (chi middleware signature), RequireAdmin, context accessors
  - `src/internal/router/router.go` — chi router with route groups (public, authenticated, admin)
- Consolidated duplicate `isUniqueViolation` helper (was in both auth and channel) into `service/helpers.go`
- Consolidated cookie helpers from `auth/helpers.go` into `httputil/httputil.go` (SetRefreshTokenCookie, ClearRefreshTokenCookie)
- Updated `ws/handler.go` to import `service.AuthService` instead of `auth.Service`
- Slimmed `main.go` down to config loading + service wiring only
- Moved Go module root to `src/` — `go.mod` and `main.go` live in `src/`, eliminating `cmd/server/` nesting
- Import paths shortened from `den/src/internal/...` to `den/internal/...`
- `embed.go` changed from `package src` to `package main` (same package as `main.go`)
- Deleted old packages: `internal/auth/`, `internal/channel/`, `internal/message/`
- Deleted placeholder packages: `internal/admin/`, `internal/dm/`, `internal/embed/`, `internal/voice/`
- Added chi standard middleware: RealIP, RequestID, Logger, Recoverer, Compress, Heartbeat(`/healthz`)
- Build output goes to `bin/` at project root (`cd src && go build -o ../bin/den .`)
- Added `.dockerignore` for build context efficiency
- `go build`, `go vet` both pass clean
- No changes to API contracts, frontend, or database layer

### Run 5 (2026-03-08)
- No `color` column in users table — plan referenced it but schema doesn't have it. Colors generated client-side via username hash instead.
- No virtual list — simple scrollable div with load-more-on-scroll-up is sufficient for current scale
- No optimistic message sending — WS broadcast used as single source of truth
- Presence tracked via WS only — no REST endpoint for online users; `presence_initial` on connect provides initial state
- Svelte 5 reactivity with Set/Map requires creating new instances on mutation (reassignment pattern)
- Hub refactored to use `removeClient` helper to DRY up cleanup logic across register/unregister/broadcast cases

### Run 6 (2026-03-09)
- Settings (open_registration, instance_name) are runtime-only in-memory toggles — not persisted to DB
- Admin routes nested inside existing admin middleware group (reuses `RequireAdmin` middleware)
- `CountChannels` query added to messages.sql (alongside `CountMessages`) since it's used only by admin stats
- Password reset generates 16 hex chars (8 random bytes) and revokes all refresh tokens for the user
- WS event listener registration moved before `websocket.connect()` in `+page.svelte` to avoid dropped messages on connect

## Known Deviations from Plan

- **No Makefile or gofer.json** — Both had Windows/MSYS path translation issues with Docker volume mounts. Commands documented in CLAUDE.md instead.
- **Postgres port 5440** instead of 5432 — ports 5432-5434 were already in use on host.
- **5-minute access tokens** instead of 15 — tighter security window, negligible UX impact with refresh rotation.
- **No shadcn-svelte CLI init** — bits-ui installed directly, `cn()` utility created manually. Components will be added as needed in future runs.
- **Layered architecture instead of per-domain packages** — Plan originally listed `internal/auth/`, `internal/channel/`, etc. Refactored to `service/`, `handler/`, `middleware/`, `router/` layers with chi router. Future features (admin, embed, voice) will add files to existing layers rather than creating new top-level packages.

## Notes for Next Run

- Postgres is running on port 5440, all migrations applied through 000005
- Auth is fully wired frontend-to-backend: login, register, refresh, logout all work through the Vite proxy
- `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` prefix needed for Docker commands with volume mounts in Git Bash
- **Go module root is `src/`** — build with `cd src && go build -o ../bin/den .`, run with `cd src && go run .`
- **Architecture is now layered**: business logic in `service/`, HTTP handlers in `handler/`, middleware in `middleware/`, routing in `router/`. New features add files to existing layers.
- **Chi router** is used — route params accessed via `chi.URLParam(r, "id")`, not `r.PathValue("id")`
- Channel CRUD requires admin for create/update/delete; list/get requires auth
- WebSocket connects via `GET /api/ws?token=<JWT>` (query param auth since browsers can't set WS headers — browser WebSocket API doesn't support custom headers)
- Message cursor pagination uses `before_time` + `before_id` query params (both required together)
- Hub uses channel-based select loop for all operations — no mutexes needed. Hub now also handles presence tracking and `BroadcastExclude` for typing.
- Tailwind v4 uses `@theme inline` block in app.css for custom colors (no `tailwind.config.js`)
- shadcn-svelte components can be added incrementally (bits-ui is installed, cn utility exists)
- Vite dev server proxies `/api` → `http://localhost:8080` with `ws: true` for WebSocket upgrade support
- Frontend stores follow factory pattern with `$state` runes in `.svelte.ts` files
- User colors are generated client-side from username hash — no `color` column in DB
- Three-column layout: ChannelSidebar (w-60) | MessageArea (flex-1) | MemberList (w-60)
- Admin panel at `/admin` — admin-only, 4 tabs (users, channels, messages, settings)
- Admin settings (open_registration, instance_name) are in-memory only — reset on server restart
- Admin routes: `/api/admin/users`, `/api/admin/users/{id}/admin`, `/api/admin/users/{id}/reset-password`, `/api/admin/users/{id}` (DELETE), `/api/admin/stats`, `/api/admin/messages/cleanup`, `/api/admin/settings`
